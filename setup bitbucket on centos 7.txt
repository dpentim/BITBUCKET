SETUP BITBUCKET ON CENTOS-7

In this post I will go through the full fresh installation of Atlassian Bitbucket on Centos7. I have fresh Centos installation which I will dedicate it to Bitbucket server. I will also use PostgreSQL as database. Atlassian has a guide for this but it is very generic to cover all possible combinations and doesn’t go into the details of installation and configuration of database. This post will have all you need to know on how to install Atlassian Bitbucket on Centos 7 in one place.
Prerequisite
OS: Centos 7
Bitbucket: atlassian-bitbucket-7.6.0-x64
Database: PostgreSQL-9.5
GIT: Bitbucket version 7 and above requires git-2.0 and above
Preparation
Firsly you need to install git version 2 or above. 
Follow the steps below to install a stable and latest git
Remove any git version
$ sudo yum remove git*
The quickest way of installing the latest version of Git on CentOS 7 is from the End Point repository.
$ sudo yum -y install https://packages.endpoint.com/rhel/7/os/x86_64/endpoint-repo-1.7-1.x86_64.rpm
Once repository is added, install Git 2.x on CentOS 7:
$ sudo yum install git
Check git version after installing git2u-all package
$ git --version
Install Latest Git (2.x) from source on CentOS 7
As confirmed, the current version of Git is 2.24.1. But if you need more latest as at the time of your installation, you can follow these additional steps.
In this method, you’ll be tasked with building git from source code. Install dependency packages required:
$ sudo yum -y install epel-release
$ sudo yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
$ sudo yum -y install wget perl-CPAN gettext-devel perl-devel  openssl-devel  zlib-devel curl-devel expat-devel  getopt asciidoc xmlto docbook2X
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/db2x_docbook2texi /usr/bin/docbook2x-texi
Now Download and install  using the following command:
$ export VER="2.27.0"
$ wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v${VER}.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf v${VER}.tar.gz
$ cd git-*
$ make configure
$ sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ sudo make
$ sudo make install
Now you can check the version again:
$ git --version
Download and install bitbucket
Firstly, cd into /opt/ then download using the link below
$ sudo wget https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash/downloads/binary/atlassian-bitbucket-7.6.0-x64.bin
Make it executable
$ sudo chmod +x atlassian-bitbucket-7.6.0-x64.bin
Make the file below executable
 sudo chmod +x atlassian-bitbucket-7.6.0-x64.bin 
Start bit-bucket by running the following command
$ sudo ./atlassian-bitbucket-7.6.0-x64.bin
You will see something like these, follow the prompt.

[/opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.3.2]
Default location for Bitbucket home directory
The location for Bitbucket data.This will be the default location for repositories, plugins, and other data.
Ensure that this location is not used by another Bitbucket installation.[/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket]
Configure which ports Bitbucket will use.

Bitbucket requires two TCP ports that are not being used by any other
applications.
The HTTP port is where users will access Bitbucket through their browsers.The control port is used to start and stop Bitbucket.
HTTP Port Number[7990]8060Control Port Number[8006]


For a production server we recommend that you run Bitbucket as aWindows/Linux service because Bitbucket will restart automatically when the
computer restarts.Install Bitbucket as a service?Yes [y, Enter], No [n]

Open firewall ports
Centos 7 now comes with firewalld pre-installed and activated by default. You need to open the needed ports to be able to access to the server through web browser.
First check the active zones:
firewall-cmd --get-active-zonespublic
  interfaces: eth0
then add the ports to the zones you want (public here)
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8060/tcp --permanent
Then remember to reload the firewall for changes to take effect.
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
install database engine and connector
Atlassian highly recommends not to use MySQL/MariaDB for the external database in real servers for Bitbucket. It seems to have performance and bug issues. PostgreSQL instead is the recommended database engine. So here i will install them.
sudo yum localinstall sudo yum localinstall https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib

sudo postgresql-setup initdb

After initializing the database, you can start the database using:
sudo systemctl start postgresql

sudo yum update

PostgreSQL Basic Setup
In Linux by default, a user named postgres is created once PostgreSQL is installed. You can change the user’s password with the following command:
sudo passwd postgres

su - postgres

psql postgres

CREATE SCHEMA bitbucket;
CREATE USER bitbucketuser PASSWORD 'password';

GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA bitbucket TO bitbucketuser;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA bitbucket TO bitbucketuser;
CREATE DATABASE bitbucket WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER=bitbucketuser CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;
.\q

Exit


Post-installation commands
After installing the packages, a database needs to be initialised and configured.
Data Directory
The PostgreSQL data directory has all the data files for the database. The variable PGDATA is used to reference this directory.
export PGDATA /var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data
Initialise
The first command (only needed once) is to initialise the database in PGDATA.
sudo /usr/pgsql-9.5/bin/postgresql95-setup initdb
 
Control service
To control the database service in RHEL 7.1+ and CentOS 7.1+, Systemd is introduced.
Use this to start the service and make sure it starts at the startup:
 systemctl start postgresql-9.5.service
 systemctl enable postgresql-9.5.service
create and setup database
su -
now you're loged in as admin.
#su - postgres
-bash-4.2$ psql
psql (9.2.14, server 9.5.1)
WARNING: psql version 9.2, server version 9.5.
 Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.

Now you are in the psql environment. run below commands
CREATE SCHEMA bitbucket;
CREATE USER bitbucketuser PASSWORD 'bitbucketdbpassword';
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA bitbucket TO bitbucketuser;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA bitbucket TO bitbucketuser;
CREATE DATABASE bitbucket WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER=bitbucketuser CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;
configure authentication methods
default authentication method for local connections in PostgreSQL is set to ‘ident’ that means it will get the operating system user name of the client by contacting the ident server on the client and check if it matches the requested database user name. You can read more on this on official PostgreSQL site.
As we are not planing to have a ident server this needs to be updated. I use md5 method. Other methods can be used too depending on the situation. All these settings resting in pg_hba.conf file in data folder of the postgresql installation.
so need to do below:
sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/pg_hba.conf
just one line needs to be updated. It is towards the end of the file (line 82 in my case) the one starts with host.
this line:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
needs to be updated to:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
then restart the service.
Now all is set to start setting up your bitbucket server.
Set up Bitbucket
Now open web browser and point to the address that you installed the server.
Select the language and PostgreSQL as external or internal depending on you DB installation.
